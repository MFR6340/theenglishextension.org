## Supplemental Activities
if you've ever had dreams of flying, the final venue of the Parachute World Cup Finals in Locarno from September 22-24, 2023,  might be an event that's worth going to.  Over 200 of the top sky divers from 20 nations compete for the titles with a focus on the accuracy of their landing.  And it's all happening while you're working on this unit.  A great excuse to go!  <a href="https://yellow-target.ch/" rel="nofollow">Yellow Target Skydiving World Cup</a>
