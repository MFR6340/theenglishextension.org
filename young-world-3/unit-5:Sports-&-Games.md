# Supplemental Activities

There really can't be a discussion about sports without it eventually turning to the Olympics.  And what better place to go to learn about this amazing event than the Olympic Museum!

It's not just skiing that takes place in the Alps of Switzerland.  Bobsledding has been a major sport for years.  Next time you are in St. Moritz, check out the BobMuseum.
