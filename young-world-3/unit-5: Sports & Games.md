**This unit covers Sports Day (also called Field Day), a popular tradition in schools to celebrate the end of the year.  The day usually consists in a variety of outdoor games including relay races, running, and other activities.   This is not an easy unit to find supplemental literature.  The books below have therefore expanded on the Field Day theme to include information on famous athletes.**

# Supplemental Activities

There really can't be a discussion about sports without it eventually turning to the Olympics.  And what better place to go to learn about this amazing event than the Olympic Museum in Lausanne!

It's not just skiing that takes place in the Alps of Switzerland.  Bobsledding has been a major sport for years.  Next time you are in St. Moritz, check out the BobMuseum and learn about a sport you might not have thought a lot about.
