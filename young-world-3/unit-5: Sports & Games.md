**This unit covers Sports Day (also called Field Day), a popular tradition in schools to celebrate the end of the year.  The day usually consists in a variety of outdoor games focusing often on running and  relay races as well as  other activities.   This is not an easy topic on which to find supplemental literature.  The books below have therefore expanded on the Field Day theme to include information on famous runners and sports in general.** 

## Sports Day
### Daisy and the Trouble with Sports Day by Kes Gray

<img src="https://imgur.com/HtiLUsi.png" width="25%" />

This is a very funny, quick and easy read. It's about Daisy who has a habit of getting into trouble. She isn't very sporty but wants to win a race at her school sports day. She tries to train really hard but runs into trouble along the way, everyone else in her class wants to win too so it won't be easy for Daisy!

## Great Runners and Track Events
###  DK: Life Stories Jesse Owens

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dPMlj0k.png" width="25%" />

Jesse Owens is the most famous athlete in Track and Field history despite many odds.  His grandparents had been slaves, his parents were poor sharecroppers.  He set multiple world- records, including three in less than an hour, considered to be the "greatest 45 minutes in sport."  In 1936, he won 4 Gold medals in the Berlin Olympics, disrupting Hitler's plan to show Aryan superiority.  It's worthwhile reading about this truly inspirational athlete.  (Lexile 920L)

# Supplemental Activities

There really can't be a discussion about sports without it eventually turning to the Olympics.  And what better place to go to learn about this amazing event than the Olympic Museum in Lausanne!

It's not just skiing that takes place in the Alps of Switzerland.  Bobsledding has been a major sport for years.  Next time you are in St. Moritz, check out the BobMuseum and learn about a sport you might not have thought a lot about.
