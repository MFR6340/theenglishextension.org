**This unit covers Sports Day (also called Field Day), a popular tradition in schools to celebrate the end of the year.  The day usually consists in a variety of outdoor games focusing often on running and  relay races as well as  other activities.   This is not an easy topic on which to find supplemental literature.  The books below have therefore expanded on the Field Day theme to include information on famous runners and sports in general.**

### The Race of the Century: The Battle to Break the Four-Minute Mile by Neal Bascomb
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fOLrBmZ.png" width="25%" />

The book is centered on three athletes in three continents trying to run a mile as fast as four minutes. The athletes were in the UK, USA and Australia. At the time it was considered by most to be too dangerous to run so fast and foolhardy to try, but at the same time, it was extremely interesting to find out if anyone could do it. It's a gripping read, telling of injuries, family issues and overbearing coaches making the reader unsure of what might happen next and who would be the first to run the four minute mile.

This book is an adaptation for younger readers of Neal Bascomb's bestselling book The Perfect Mile. (1030L)
