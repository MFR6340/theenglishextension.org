## Ish, by Peter H. Reynolds

<img src="https://imgur.com/UtViGvL.png" width="25%" />

A boy named Ramon loves to draw until an unkind remark by his older brother causes him to stop.  His little sister convinces him to start again. At first glance, this may seem like just a simple picture book, but the message about creativity is far deeper and is a wonderful lesson for kids and adults of all ages.

## Marguerite Makes a Book, by Bruce Robertson

<img src="https://imgur.com/Obtul5O.png" width="25%" />

An historical fiction account of a girl in Medieval Paris who helps her father complete an illuminated tome for a wealthy patron. Although parts of it are not fully historically accurate (clothing, female independence, etc.)  it is still very much a worthwhile book to get a better understanding of how the vellum and paints for manuscripts were made.

## The Seventh Most Important Thing, by Shelley Pearsall

<img src="https://imgur.com/DpHYsvF.png" width="25%" />

Arthur is assigned 120 hours of community service to help a “Junk Man,” Mr. Hampton, after he had thrown a brick at him. His job is to collect seven junk items, including cardboard, and light bulbs from the Mr. Hampton’s list, without knowing their intended purpose. Through each item on the list, Arthur begins to grow and gets closer to redemption. Loosely based on a true story of an artist named Hampton who made a masterpiece out of junk.

## Black Book of Colors, by Menena Cottin

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ld6dtz.png" width="25%" />

This book is shows how it would to be blind. It is entirely black, with raised drawings, and written both in text and braille (though not deep enough to be easily read by a blind person). It uses other senses to explain how to perceive colors. “Red is sour like unripe strawberries and as sweet as watermelon.” It’s a great starting point to talk about color.

## Supplemental Activities
### Visit an Art Museum
Switzerland has over 1,100 museums, making it one of countries with the highest number per capita, so there's no excuse not to find one that holds something of interest.  Make sure you go to the Kuntshaus in Zurich and the Kunsthaus in Basel, but here's some others: 

 - Zentrum Paul Klee
	Show-casing one of Switzerland's most renowned artists, and hosting around 4,000 pieces of his work, the museum in Bern conducts guided tours and also has interactive programs for children.  Find more information here: https://www.zpk.org/en/art-mediation/guided-tours-43.html
	
 - Angelika Kaufmann Museum
	Kaufmann was a famous female 18th Century Swiss artist who established an international reputation for her landscapes and portraits.  In 1768, she became one of only two female artists who co-founded the Royal Academy in London.  Born in Chur, Kaufmann also had close ties to Schwarzenburg, Austria (a 45 minute drive from St. Gallen)  where the museum is located.  Worth a quick visit to emphasis the talent and skill of an amazing woman who was recognized at a time when few women were.  http://angelika-kauffmann.com/das-museum/oeffnungszeiten
 
 - Rosegarten Collection
This museum in Lucern has works by Swiss artist Paul Klee, as well as other Classic Modernist and Impressionist artists including Pablo Picasso, and Renoir and Cézanne. https://www.rosengart.ch/en/welcome
 - Claire Ochsner Museum and Sculpture Garden
On page 27, is a sculpture by Swiss artist Claire Ochsner which can be seen in person in Zug near Metalli and the train station.  She has many more sculptures all over Switzerland.  She also has a sculpture garden in Frenkendorf, ten minutes from Basel, which is open from 16.00-18.00 every Friday.  http://www.claire-ochsner.ch/skulpturgarten/

### Visit a Church

In the 1970s, Artist Marc Chagall created a five-part stained-glass window series and a rosette for the <a href="https://www.fraumuenster.ch/4.php?read_category=2770" rel="nofollow">Fraumünster Church</a>  in Zurich.  These colorful windows are by visitors from all over the world.

### Do a Puzzle
You can still get some culture and have fun while remaining in your living room.  There's really no better way to become familiar with the minute details of a work of fine art than by doing a puzzle.  
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8bQLA0S.png" width="55%" />
Wentworth makes puzzles from paintings by Van Gogh, Renoir, Seurat, and many other famous artists.  They also have special pieces, in interesting shapes like paint brushes and boats that match the theme.  Beware, if you do get one, don't begin with one with more than 250 pieces, as they can be challenging.  A straight piece does not necessarily mean it's an edge.  Good fun on cold day.  https://www.wentworthpuzzles.com/us/fine-art-jigsaw-puzzles-2/all-fine-art-puzzles  Also available on Amazon, John Lewis, and other stores.
