### MVP*: Magellan Voyage Project, by Douglas Evans

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n6FEYvP.png" width="45%" />

This fun book is out of print and therefore can only be found used.  It's worth the search. Adam is competing against others for a four million dollar prize to be the first around the world in forty days without flying.  Lots of action and adventure, and of course, an evil Baron.  (Lexile 690L)
