## Supplemental Activities
### Visit an Art Museum
Switzerland has over 1,100 museums, making it one of countries with the highest number per capita, so there's no excuse not to find one that holds something of interest.  

 - Zentrum Paul Klee
	Show-casing one of Switzerland's most renowned artists, and hosting around 4,000 pieces of his work, the museum in Bern conducts guided tours and also has interactive programs for children.  Find more information here: https://www.zpk.org/en/art-mediation/guided-tours-43.html
	Angelika Kaufmann Museum
	Kaufmann was a famous female Swiss artist who built in international reputation in the 18th Century.  In 1768, she became one of only two female artists who co-founded the Royal Academy in London.  Born in Chur, Kaufmann also had close ties to Schwarzenburg, Austria, 
	
	



### Do a Puzzle
You can still get some culture and have fun while remaining in your living room.  There's really no better way to become familiar with a work of art than to do a puzzle.
