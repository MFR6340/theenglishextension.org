## Carry On, Mr. Bowditch, by Jean Lee Latham

<img src="https://imgur.com/6rfoBak.png" width="25%" />

This amazing biography of Nathaniel Bowditch was the winner of the Newbery Medal. Nat was a sailor in the 1800s who developed new techniques for navigation using math, despite having only attended school until he was 12. The book is the fascinating, griping and profoundly moving story of Nat’s hardships and his perseverance in overcoming them. (Lexile 570L)  <sup>[what is this?](/resources/Lexile%20measures)</sup>

From the development of the steam engine, to the building of steamships, to designing the *SS United States*, the last and most advanced of these stately ships, Macaulay does an amazing job explaining technical concepts with fantastic illustrations so that even those who might not think they had an interest in engines or shipbuilding will develop one by the end.
