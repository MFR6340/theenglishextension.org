# Supplemental Activities
What can more Scottish than the **Highland Games**?  Without even having to leave Switzerland, you have a chance to go see one of these amazing events.  The Highland Games Verband Schweiz organizes events every year.  For the program for this year.  https://www.hgvs.ch/saison-2023

A well-played **bagpipe** stirs the soul of those who are graced to hear it.  Located in Lenzburg, Aargau, David Fleming plays at events, and even provides lessons for those who are interested in playing themselves.  His website contains information about Scottish events he hosts.  https://www.davidflemingbagpiper.com/

You don't need to leave Switzerland to see **Highland Dancing** or to learn how to do it yourself.  Classes are available in Zug and Lenzburg.  Events vary throughout the year.  Check Flora dance's website
