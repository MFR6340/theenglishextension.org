# Supplemental Activities

Rock climbing is a great example of a sport where boundaries are constantly being pushed.  What wasn't recognized for a long time was how many women have participated in this amazing sport.  Through October 2023, the Swiss Alpine Museum at the Gotthard is hosting the exhibit "**Women on the Mountain**" focusing on the fearlessness of forty female alpinists.  https://www.alpinesmuseum.ch/en/exhibitions/lost-and-found-memories-office
