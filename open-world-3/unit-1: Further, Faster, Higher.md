# Supplemental Activities



Ice climbing is definitely an extreme sport, and Switzerland is hosting the <a href="https://www.saas-fee.ch/en/events/top-events-in-winter/ice-climbing-worldcup" rel="nofollow">Ice Climbing World Cup </a>  If you happen to be in Saas Fee in January, it could be great fun to watch.  Held in a car park, so weather isn't an excuse not to go.  Catch a video here to see what it's like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpLqDgWKLhc

Rock climbing is a great example of a sport where boundaries are constantly being pushed.  What wasn't recognized for a long time was how many women have participated in this amazing sport.  Through October 2023, the Swiss Alpine Museum at the Gotthard is hosting the exhibit <a href="https://www.alpinesmuseum.ch/en/exhibitions/lost-and-found-memories-office" rel="nofollow">"Women on the Mountain" </a> focusing on the fearlessness of forty female alpinists.
