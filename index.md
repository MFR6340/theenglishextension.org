## Welcome to The English Extension Organization! 


The English Extension Organization (TEEO) is a collaboration of experienced teachers from various English-speaking countries who all have children in Swiss state schools. The group is producing materials to provide language development support for English-speaking students which can be used both at school and at home.

We believe that literacy is essential and that every child can become a better reader.  We hope this website provides useful information, book lists and resources to help provide English support in the local Swiss schools.
