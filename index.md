## Welcome to The English Extension Organization! 


The English Extension Organization (TEEO) is a collaboration of experienced teachers from various English-speaking countries who all have children in Swiss state schools. The group is producing materials to provide language development support for English-speaking students which can be used both at school and at home.

We know that it is difficult for teachers to provide special instruction and materials to native English speakers while simultaneously teaching all the other regular students in the classroom.  We want to support  teachers so that they don't have to scramble around trying to find ideas.

We also know that parents can always benefit with suggestions of reading materials for children at all reading levels and age levels.

We believe that literacy is essential and that every child can become a better reader.  We hope this website provides useful information, book lists and resources to help provide English support in the local Swiss schools.
