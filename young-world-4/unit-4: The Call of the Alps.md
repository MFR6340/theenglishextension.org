<img src="https://imgur.com/XPkX05Y.png" width="25%" />

The classic children's novel, originally published in German, is about an charming orphan girl who is sent to live with her grandfather high in the Swiss Alps. She befriends Peter, the goatherd, and is adored by all.  You can’t be a child in Switzerland and not read this classic. It’s an excellent way to learn about descriptive settings and to learn about using landscapes to create atmospheric writing.Originally published in 1880-81 in two parts. Because it is now out of copyright there are quite a few English translations available including ones for free on [Gutenberg](href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1448").
Lexile measure varies based on translation.
