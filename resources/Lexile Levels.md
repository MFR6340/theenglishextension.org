**Reading level**

  

How do you determine if a book is the correct reading level for your child?

  

There are a variety of ways to categorize books for readers. Books can be classified by age level, grade level and/or reading level. Since two kids of the same age in the same class are not necessarily able to read books of the same level, using age and grade level recommendations is not ideal.

  

  

There are a variety of quantitative approaches to determine the reading level of a book, including Guided Reading Levels (GRL), Accelerated Reader (AR), Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) and Lexile Levels (LL).

  

We have chosen to use Lexile Levels, as there are over 100 million books and reading materials which have been measured using this leveling system.

  

It assigns a lexile level to a child, based on the readerâ€™s ability to comprehend text.

  

It also assigns a level to many books and other reading materials, so that students, parents and teachers can find appropriate books at their reading levels.

  

It measures the reading challenge measured by a text, based on word frequency and sentence strength.

  

Students are tested and given a lexile score based on the difficulty of the text.

  

Lexile measure are given from 200L for beginning readers and text to 1600L for advanced readers and text.

  

They should be independently reading books that are at an appropriate lexile level, or between 100 points below or 50 points above their designated reading level.

  

The objective with reading levels is to find a books that are the correct INDEPENDENT reading level for your child.

  

  

  

Parents should not worry as much about what level a child is currently at, but rather, if the child is showing growth in reading over the academic year.
