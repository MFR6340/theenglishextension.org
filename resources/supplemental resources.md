### Listening Comprehension
[https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/](https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/) A useful website to work on listening comprehension, which despite being natives, many kids still often struggle with. Goes up to C1

### Describing Emotions
Sometimes it's a challenge to find the right word or emotion.  Often, there's a better or more precise way to say it.  This fabulous emotion wheel by Geoffrey Roberts is a great way to helps kids (and adults) express their feelings more clearly.  It obviously helps improves descriptive writing skills and character development  as well.
