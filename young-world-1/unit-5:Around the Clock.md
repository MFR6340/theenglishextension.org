### The Thirteen Clocks, by James Thurber

<img src="https://imgur.com/Z6h3leZ.png" width="45%"  />

This book is more fantasy, word-play and adventure than clock related, but it's such good fun.  An evil Duke has been cursed with on his kingdom.  In the kingdom of an evil Duke, it is so cold that all of the hands of the 13 clocks in the castle are frozen.  He has "killed time".  The Duke sets up impossible tasks for the young men who come to ask for the hand of Princess Saralinda, with the result of such men being fed to the Duke's geese.  It's actually good fun, as long as the kids can handle a bit of blood and guts and has as happy ending, as it should.  (Lexile 800L)
