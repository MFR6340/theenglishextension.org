Due to the basic level, the unit covers only very general terms and ideas including:  families from around the world, English-speaking countries, flags from other countries and descriptions of people.  Here are some suggestions for native English speakers to delve deeper into this theme:**

### Describing Emotions
When we describe ourselves or other people, we usually start with how we look.  But a really good description tells how a person FEELS as well.   This fabulous emotion wheel by Geoffrey Roberts is a great way to find some precise words to use when telling or writing about a person or a character in a book.  Print this chart and hang it on the door of the refrigerator or the bathroom mirror for a week or two.
