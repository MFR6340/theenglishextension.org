## Supplemental Materials

### Describing Emotions
When we describe ourselves or other people, we usually start with how we look.  But a really good description tells how a person FEELS as well.   This fabulous emotion wheel by Geoffrey Roberts is a great way to find some precise words to use when telling or write about a person or a character in a book.  Print this chart and hang it on the door or the refrigerator or bathroom mirror for a week or two.
